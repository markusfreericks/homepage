<h1>Joyce, Machine Translation, and AI</h1>

Maybe five years ago, I read an old Arno Schmidt essay (originally, a radio
feature) on the language in Finnegans Wake. Schmidt is a not very
well-known German author, dead for a quarter century. (And most renowned
for his epic masterpiece "Zettels Traum" - a book that no-one owns, let
alone reads, since the only accessible edition is a DIN A3 typoscript
reproduction monster that costs ~400 DM. His lesser writings (short
stories, historic novellas, essays and radio features) are often quite funny
in an ethnographical way, but his idiosyncratic use of orthography and
punctuation makes him hard to read.)  Schmidt earned his living by
translating (English -&gt; German), and in that essay he wrote about the
language used by Joyce in FW, which is an extension of the
stream-of-consciousness idea already present in the (much more readable)
Ulysses. Schmidt noted that languages have a semantic level below the
lexeme level that we take for granted. This lower level (now what was his
word for it?) consists of the "roots" of words that are powerful enough to
evoke associations, but not precise enough to have a unique semantics. FW
is supposed to be written at this level, and the "crossword puzzler &amp;
punster" nature of the text is a consequence of this. Schmidt demonstrates
his idea on a few words from one paragraph from FW (Jugurtha).

<p>

When I encountered works on machine translation (Maschinelle Übersetzung),
I formed the impression that most approaches worked on the basis of
grammatical sentences and semantic dictionaries, with the "holy grail"
consisting of a totally descriptive german or English grammar, combined
with a semantic net that contains the whole Encyclopedia
Brittanica. Translation is usually depicted as consisting of several
analysis steps; from the "token" level (phonetic/lexical) up to word &amp;
phrase recognition, sentence-level grammar, and context analysis ("context"
being everything beyond a complete sentence). This is a nice, methodical,
and analytical approach, but it hinges upon the pre-existence of "a
semantics" that is to be detected. What if there is none? What if there are
many possible semantices? What if a poem is to be analyzed, or a piece of
FW? 

<p> 

You might say that machine translation is only advocated for highly
formalized, technical or juristical writings, but that argument doesn't
cut:
Even the most technical texts contain subtilities such as emphasis by
inverted word order, choice of words to improve connotations, or
metaphorical use of language: How often have you read that a browser
"travels" "up" a "tree", starting "at" the "root" nodes? Humans have no
problems with these metaphors, use them freely, invent and extend them on
the spot, and mix them without anyone even noticing. A machine translation
database needs special knowledge about each metaphor (and I tend to think
that the translation are often only acceptable because the source and
target language share most of their "metaphor space", so that the 1:1
translation doesn't do much damage).

<p>

Now my intuition is this: the translation process should be based on the
<em>acceptance</em> of non-unique semantics, instead of viewing them as a
problem. "The semantics" of a word, a sentence, a paragraph, or even a
complete text would then more correspond to a "wave function" (to use a
trite new-age physical metaphor, but I don't know a better one) instead of
a "data structure" (semantic net, grammar) as it is now perceived. A very
technical text would have a "wave function" with a "narrow peak",
signifying a low tendency of misunderstanding; an ambiguous sentence like
"jack and john went swimming. he drowned." would have two peaks, signifying
the two primary interpretations (jack drowned/john drowned), and many
smaller peaks for the improbable, but still possible, meanings (somebody
else drowned / "drowned" or "swimming" is used in a different meaning / "he
drowned" is unmarked direct speech / ...).

<p>

I have, of course, no idea of how to represent such a "probabilistic
semantics", nor how to build inference or composition rules for them. But
the basic idea is already present in the Schmidt essay: if there is a
semantics in each phoneme (if only the meaning: "this phoneme is the start
of the following lexemes" ;-), composing two phonemes amounts to "adding"
(or multiplying/cutting) their "semantic fields"; adding new words and
punctuation will cut down on the possible interpretation space, as will the
context of the previous paragraphs (which not only gives meaning to
relational words (he, it) that refer "back", but also weights the
interpretation of already used words).

<p>

I gather that such a system would go a far step toward true Artificial
Intelligence.

rec.arts.books) of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230324214225/http://www.mcs.net/~jorn/">Jorn Barger</a>, who
has both an interest in Joyce and has been working in AI for some time. I
haven't read his articles in detail, but gather that Jorn seems more to
think on the lines of situation descriptions and story lines.</i>

<i>(24.04.95)</i> After two day's search, I yesterday found the reference
(I had mis-remembered the anthology in question ;-). The essay is called
"Das Buch Jedermann" (The Book Everyone), and the terminus coined for the
meanginful sub-word entity is "etym". To Schmidt, etyms form the
"language of the (un)consciousness", and a stream-of-consciousness should
be written as a sequence of etyms.
