nML - the next generation

Some people out there work on expanding nML. From time to time, i gather a few links.

Generic Approach to Performance Modeling and Its Application to Simulator
Generator </a> (Thesis) V. Rajesh, Roll Number: 9611123 August, 1998 <br>

An integrated environment for performance modeling is desirable in the
present era of specification driven system design. With the complexity and
the number of processors increasing rapidly, it is important to have a
generic environment wherein the performance can be measured for a given
processor on a given application. In this thesis, a simple, elegant and
powerful language Sim-nML has been designed for performance
modeling. Sim-nML acts as the specification language for a processor
performance model in a generic way. As part of this thesis work, a
generator for processor instruction set simulator is designed and
implemented. The simulator generator takes Sim-nML specifications of a
uniprocessor machine as input and produces code for the simulator. The
performance simulator thus generated is an important tool in system design
environment as it is useful to study the performance impact due to various
design trade-offs.
