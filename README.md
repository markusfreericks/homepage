# homepage

in the good old days, i had a homepage. you could find it on www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~mfx. somewhere in 1995, i had to abandon it when my PhD funding ran out; for a while, a copy could be found at uni bielefeld (where my Doktorvater had moved to). after that, the last snapshot was on mfx.dasburo.com (dasburo.com was the company i worked at, for more then 25 years) which is now also defunct.
x   
at the time (1994? the very first widely avaiable browser, NCSA Mosaic, had just come out - i was browser the meager web on a monochrome sparcstation (elc? slc?)) everyone at our department was doing homepages, to present themselves, their work, and link lists -- a "home page" was the start page of your browser then, and there were no bookmarks within the browser then.

so here is my new attempt at preservation of ancient history.

### what to find here, eventually

(this is currently a to-do list. i am writing this in december 2025, since i have a few vacation days. no idea how much energy i can find to finish this)

- a tiny "about me" section [about.html]
- my annotated list of publications (sorry, nothing new since i did my PhD work. i have written lots of documentation and white papers, but they were all customer-related or otherwise internal)
- maybe a bit about the nML machine description language (strangely enough my only lasting legacy to computer science)
- some musings about ALDiSP (the language i never really finished the compiler for)
- *no* copy of my old "trash heap" link list (99% of which would point to nothing), or the old DHTML experiments (which would not work under modern browsers), or my rants (which have not been relevant for 20 years).
- also, *no* copy of the Arabian Nights (back then, i hosted a copy that i had found a copy on a gopher server, and converted from a massive text blob to manageable HTML pages)
- maybe a reading list?
- maybe the "people" list, updated?
- the quotations file, and random quotation snippet service, if i can find out how to host it - obviously, there is no chance to run a cgi-bin in github.
